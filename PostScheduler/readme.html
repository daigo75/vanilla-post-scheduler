	<h1>Post Scheduler for Vanilla 2.0/2.1b</h1>

	<div>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		Post Scheduler allows to schedule a Discussion to appear at a later date and/or time. A scheduled discussion will be invisible to all Users, except the following:
		<ul>
			<li>The User who started the discussion.</li>
			<li>Super Administrators.</li>
			<li>Any User with the permission to see all Scheduled discussions.</li>
		</ul>

		For more details, please see Plugin's Settings page.
	</div>
	<div>
		<h3>Installation</h3>
		<div>
			<ol>
				<li>Copy the PostScheduler folder in the <strong>/plugins</strong> folder, which can be found in your Vanilla installation folder.</li>
				<li>Delete all <strong>.ini</strong> files from the <strong>cache</strong> folder and all its subfolders. <strong>Cache</strong> folder is also in your Vanilla installation folder.</li>
				<li>Enable the Post Scheduler Plugin.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<h3>Upgrade</h3>
		<div>
			<ol>
				<li>In Vanilla Control Panel, disable the Post Scheduler Plugin. <strong>Do not skip this step.</strong></li>
				<li>Delete all <strong>.ini</strong> files from the <strong>cache</strong> folder and all its subfolders. <strong>Cache</strong> folder is also in your Vanilla installation folder.</li>
				<li>Enable the Post Scheduler Plugin.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<p>
			At the end of the Installation or Upgrade, open the Plugin's Settings page. At the bottom, there should be a section titled <strong>Overrides</strong>. If all messages are <span class="OverridesOK">green</span>, then you're good to go. If any of them is <span class="OverridesError">red</span>, please read the <strong>Troubleshooting section</strong> below.
		</p>
	</div>

		<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
		<p>
			Post Scheduler requires the override of some Vanilla Core classes to work correctly. To avoid overwriting Core files, such override is performed at runtime, by loading the classes provided by the plugin in lieu of the original ones. However, Vanilla implements a caching mechanism that, sometimes, ignores the new files and loads the standard ones anyway.
		</p>
		<p>
			If the plugin doesn't seem to work correctly, please do the following:
		</p>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>In Vanilla Control Panel, disable the Post Scheduler Plugin.</li>
				<li>Delete all <strong>.ini</strong> files from the <strong>cache</strong> folder and all its subfolders. <strong>Cache</strong> folder is also in your Vanilla installation folder.</li>
				<li>Enable the Post Scheduler Plugin.</li>
				<li>Check the Plugin's Settings page to see if all override classes are now loaded correctly. If that is not the case, please contact Support (see <a href="#Support">details below</a>).</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h3>Usage</h3>
		<p>The Plugin provides an intuitive User Interface. Instructions can be found on Plugin's Settings page.</p>
		<p>
		Please note that the Plugin's User Interface has only been tested on Vanilla 2.0 with its default theme. Using a different theme will more likely require some adjustments in the interface.
		</p>
		<div>
			<h4>Handling of Scheduled Notifications</h4>
			<p>
				As of version 13.02.25, Post Scheduler will also delay the Notifications that are sent to Users who chose to be notified of new Discussions. When a Discussion is scheduled in the future, the notifications it generates are scheduled with it, and sent when appropriate.
			</p>
			<p>
				For the above mechanism to work, it's necessary to configure your server to call the Cron script periodically. Such script is provided by the <a href="http://vanillaforums.org/addon/cronjobs-plugin" target="_blank">Cron plugin</a>. Please refer to Cron plugin instructions for more information.
			</p>

		<h3>Requirements</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>PHP 5.3+</li>
			<li>Vanilla 2.0/2.1b (see <strong>Notes</strong>)</li>
			<li>Logger Plugin (either <a href="http://aelia.co/shop/basic-logger-for-vanilla-forums-2-0/" title="Basic Logger">Basic</a> or <a href="http://aelia.co/shop/advanced-logger-for-vanilla-forums-2-0/" title="Advanced Logger">Advanced</a> version) 12.10.28 or newer</li>
			<li>Cron Plugin 13.02.24 or newer</li>
			<li>Aelia Foundation Classes 13.02.27 or newer</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h3>Notes</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Plugin has been tested on Vanilla 2.1b and it should be compatibile with it. However, since Vanilla 2.1 is still in Beta, compatibility <u>cannot be guaranteed</u>. For the same reason, we provide limited assistance for installations in such environment.</li>
			<li>
				Delaying of notifications on Vanilla 2.1b is <strong>experimental</strong> and could have some issues. This is due to the new mechanism that such version uses to manage notifications, which is still incomplete and contains several bugs.
			</li>
			<li>Highlighting of scheduled Discussions has been designed for Vanilla's default theme. Using the plugin with 3rd party themes might require some adjustment to the plugin's CSS files.</li>
			<li>All dates and times displayed by the plugin on the frontend are in <strong>current User's timezone</strong>. That is, if a Post is scheduled for <i>00:00 GMT</i>, an Administrator in New York will see the it scheduled for <i>7:00 PM</i>.</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Important</strong>: this plugin requires some modifications to Vanilla Core files. Such changes are made automatically, in a non-permanent way when the plugin is enabled, and don't affect normal operations even when the plugin is disabled. <br />
				If you wish to ensure that every modification to Core files is removed when the plugin is disabled, simply remove all ini files from <strong>cache</strong> folder and its subfolders.
			</li>
